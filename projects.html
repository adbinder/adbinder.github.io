			My friend showed me a modification he had made to a pair of gardening sunglasses. The glasses shield the sides of the eyes as well as the front. My friend, David, had put black tape on the sides and front of the glasses. He left two slits untaped on the glasses near his eyes. This effectively made the glasses into blinders that restricted his field of vision to only include what was in front of him. <br/> <br/>

			I thought this was a wonderful idea, and it reminded me of something I had seen online a few years back. The Inuits in Scandinavia other arctic areas make goggles to protect their eyes from the bright sunlight that reflects off the snow. In fact, snow blindness is a real and serious condition caused by overexposure to UV light, so these goggles are necessary to protects the eyes of the Inuit.
