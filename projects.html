            <div class="p in-1">A little while back, my friend David showed me a modification he had made to a 
			pair of gardening sunglasses; the kind that shields the sides of the eyes as well 
			as the front. He had put black tape on the sides and front of the glasses, but 
			he left two slits untaped on the front near his eyes. This effectively made the 
			glasses into blinders that restricted his field of vision to only what was in 
			front of him. Apparently, he wore them when he was in a distracting 
            environment and needed to focus on homework or other tasks.

			I thought this was a great idea, and it reminded me of something I had seen 
			online a few years back. The Inuits in Scandinavia and in other Arctic areas 
			make goggles to protect their eyes from the bright sunlight that reflects off 
			the snow. In fact, snow blindness is a real and serious condition caused by 
			overexposure to UV light, so these goggles are necessary to protect the eyes of 
			the Inuit peoples. The goggles they wear are generally made out of wood or bone. 
			They carve the goggles to fit their own face, and in some cases, they carve or 
			paint patterns on the outer surface. The photos below show two examples of these 
			goggles; notice the decorative etchings on the first pair. The second pair of 
			goggles have three white circles on the front. The two circles on the sides 
			serve to hold the securing twine in place, but the one in the center is 
			decorative.

			I thought it would be nice to have similar glasses as my friend David that would 
			help me tune out distractions and study, but I also wanted to have them custom 
			made so that they were comfortable and looked cool. Thus, I set out to design my 
			own "focus goggles".

            <div class="p in-1">
            An evaporative cooler is a type of cooling system that uses water's high specific 
            heat capacity to remove heat from the air while adding humidity. Evaporative coolers 
            are also known as swamp coolers. An evaporative cooler is made of these components: 
            1 - Reservoir
            2 - Cooler Pad
            3 - Fan
            4 - Pump
